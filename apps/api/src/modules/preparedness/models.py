"""SQLAlchemy ORM models for the preparedness module (FR-PRP-*).

Columns come from docs/schema.md. Do not invent them; a missing column that a
requirement needs is a doc gap to flag, not something to freelance around.

Register every new models module in `src/db/models_registry.py`, or Alembic
autogenerate will emit a migration that drops its table.
